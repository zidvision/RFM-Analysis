# RFM Analysis for Online Retail Customers

## Project Objective  
To identify key customer segments based on purchasing behavior using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis.  
This enables the business to create targeted marketing strategies and improve customer retention for future sales growth.

## Dataset Used  
- `Online Retail`  
By: [Chen, D. (2015). Online Retail [Dataset]. UCI Machine Learning Repository. https://doi.org/10.24432/C5BW33.](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/352/online+retail)

## Business Questions Answered  
- Who are our most valuable customers?  
- Which customers are at risk of churning?  
- What customer segments can we target with loyalty programs or re-engagement campaigns?  
- How are customers distributed based on their recency, frequency, and spending?

## Process  

### Data Cleaning and Transformation 
- Removed null values, duplicates, and canceled orders  
- Converted data types (e.g., date fields) for proper analysis
- Add `Total Price` Column

### Create Customer Summary
- Imported the cleaned dataset
- Aggregated data by CustomerID to create key customer-level metrics such as:
  - **TotalOrder**: Number of transactions
  - **TotalQuantity**: Total items purchased
  - **TotalSpend**: Total monetary value spent
  - **FirstPurchase** and **LastPurchase**: First and latest purchase dates
- Additional metrics for deeper analysis:
  - **Average Basket Size** = TotalQuantity / TotalOrders
  - **Average Order Value** = TotalSpend / TotalOrders
  - **Days Since Last Purchase** = Days since last transaction (based on latest date in dataset)

  *These metrics are not directly used in RFM segmentation but provide richer insights for profiling customer behavior and designing targeted marketing strategies. These features can be used in further clustering or customer persona development beyond RFM.*

### RFM Score Calculation  
- **Recency**: Days since last purchase  
- **Frequency**: Total number of transactions  
- **Monetary**: Total money spent  
- Used quantiles to assign R, F, and M scores (1â€“5) to each customer

### Customer Segmentation  
- Combined RFM scores into segments (e.g., Champions, At Risk, Lost, etc.)  
- Segmentation using clustering logic and domain knowledge

### Dashboard Creation  
Built an interactive dashboard in **Power BI** using the RFM segment data

## Key Insights  
- The majority of customers are categorized as **Potential Loyalists**, indicating theyâ€™ve purchased recently and frequently, but still need nurturing to become top-tier customers.
- **Champions** customers have an average monetary value of over $10,000, with a recency average of 6 days, making them the most valuable and engaged segment.
- Out of 4,331 total customers, 830 (approximately 19%) are classified as **Lost**, meaning they havenâ€™t made a purchase in a long time.

---

## Conclusion  
Using RFM segmentation, we can prioritize our marketing efforts:
- Reward and retain **Champions**  
- Re-engage **At Risk** and **Hibernating** customers with promotions  
- Monitor **New** and **Potential Loyalist** customers to turn them into **Loyal** ones
